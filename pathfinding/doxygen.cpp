*	This is my first entry.
*	I would like to use this opprtunity to thank my mentor Dr. Adam Sampson,  \n
*	who in his spare time taught me the basics of how to use Doxygen.		  \n

*   \section intro_sec Introduction
*       Data structures, Algorithms, Path finding in games and Agile Development
*	are all very broad subjects. Each of them can be described as a study field
*	on its own and many books were already written in those particular areas.
*	To cover such a vast knowledge during 13 weeks of study is rather a scratch on surface,
*	but it is an intention of this coursework to present at least a fundamental learning outcome.											  															  \n
